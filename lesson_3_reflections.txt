When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

If you want to share it with others.  Also, if it's a group project and multiple people are working from the same repository.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

You might not have control of the remote repository and you don't want to pull changes that could introduce new bugs while you are making your own changes.
